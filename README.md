# HandWriitenDigits
Hand_Written_Digit/Neural_Network with Multiclass Classfication

# Overview

Handwritten digit recognition using MNIST dataset is a major project made with the help of Neural Network. It basically detects the scanned images of handwritten digits. 

## **Business Case** : 

### To classify Handwriiten Digit using CNN and various classifier model

Using Machine Learning and various data science libraries we build a model that classify the data points into given labels. We will use the following pipeline to create a reliable model:

- Problem Definition
- Data 
- Explorartory Data Analysis
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Selection
- Model Selection
- HyperParameter Tunning
- Model Evaluation
- Feature Importance

## Problem Definition

Goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

## Problem Statement
Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2:- Classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of the 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9.

Task3:- Compare between various models and find the classifier that works better.

## Attribute Information

- The input feature contains images. <br>
- Output feature contains 10 classes (digits varying from 0 to 9)

#  <span style="color:red"> Here are some of the key outcomes of the project:

- The Given dataset is Image which is very small dataset of 28 images which contains a number between 0-9.
- Equally images is not distributed between 0 to 9
- Random images dataset are available.
- All images is segerated in different different classes from 0 to 9.
- checked Data Imbalance, as dataset is small so no need to balance the image of dataset.
- As it is image classficcation problem applied , Neural Network ads well as other classification model to get better accuracy.
- With MLP Model tried with PCA also and With CNN data Agumenation is also applied. 
- Goes with other model SVM, Random Forest, KNeighbour and Kneighbour hypertunne also.
- Got 99% almost accuracy with CNN_model with dataaugmentation performthe best on current dataset.
